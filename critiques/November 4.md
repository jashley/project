Unfortunately, I couldn't find the description or plan for this project, but I will base my critique off what I remember from your previous description of the project, back in class.

##### What are one or more things that you like about this project? What's exciting?
I'm really interested to see this project come to fruition. Having played around with circuits a little bit, I'd like to see if you can come up with an easier way of working with and designing them.

##### What's the balance of language design vs sheer programming / engineering in this project?
I assume the largest challenge here will be interfacing with Minecraft, which will likely have to happen in the form of a mod. I would say that should be a stretch goal, and focus on designing the IR for designing circuits.

##### How can the project maximize the time spent on language design? How to focus on interesting, possibly new ideas?
I would say language design is one of the most important tasks here. How can you simplify the designing of circuits or redstone creations? Should you maybe give users larger, prebuilt structures and let them focus on designing more complex structures? 

##### What are some interesting language design questions that the work will have to answer? In other words, what are the design challenges? Which design problems' solutions are you looking forward to hearing about at the end of the project?
As I mentioned above, one challenge is making large structures. Maybe this isn't the focus of your language, but one of the hardest things for me when working with redstone was finding the time and patience to build complex circuits. I didn't want to build an adder because it would just take too long. I think one design question would be simplifying this process. The other is the output from your system: How will the IR be interpreted? I'm not sure how mods work, but you may have to craft your output around mods.

##### Do you know of any libraries, languages, or projects that might help this project?
Without a doubt, you should look at the mods that already exist that assist with redstone creations. How have they implemented things to simplify building? I also suspect not many, possibly no one, has designed a language for redstone creations. Maybe one thing you could do is plug into some of these already existing mods, and have your language translate text of redstone creations to input for a redstone mod.
