I've spent quite a bit of time looking over your documents and such in the
repository. I think that your DSL is really cool! I've played a lot of Minecraft 
myself, and I have to admit that circuits are definitely not something I've 
attempted to build because they seemed tedious and confusing. While the picture
of the circuit that you have as an example is somewhat unweildy, I think
that it is definitely an accomplishment. As far as comments on the design go, my
suggestion for making this output more appealing to the user would be some
more helpful information concerning the circuit as it relates to the Minecraft
world such as providing how many blocks it uses or placing the circuit on a grid
so that the user can figure out how big it will be or other characteristics of the
circuit.

As for the information that the user currently has to provide in their files,
I personally do not think that this is too much to ask of your user as long
as your language has clear and detailed instructions so that the user is not
in the dark or too confused. However,
I'm sure there are a lot of varying positions on the topic of what work you
should unload on your user vs. the language designer. Ultimately, I think that
this is a personal design choice. If you think that implementing a way for the
user to do as little work as possible might cut into your ability to add features
or other aspects that you might find more enjoyable or important, I think it
would be find to let the user have to write a few more lines in their programs.

As far as your code goes, it seems like you have done a lot of work! It also looks
like you pushed your code to github with one commit? I am not that great with github
but I was having trouble finding which files I should specifically be looking at.
