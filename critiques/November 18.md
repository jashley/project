It's good to here the conversion between logic and functions is mostly done. Are there any lingering issues there? Did you get to talk to Prof Ben?

As mentioned in class, you might be able to deal with grouping/precedence for the time being by forcing left association in your code.  It won't really handle precedence properly, and won't deal with grouping by parens, but it will be a start.  I'm not really  sure how to actually implement precedence/grouping, sorry.

How much have you thought about the final output of your program/ the interaction with Minecraft?  It seems like you're trying to do the parsing first, which is fine, but you should be sure you don't back yourself into a corner.  Any ideas about how to do it?  Maybe you can look at mods or tools for Minecraft that interact with the game in some way, and try to do what they do?  It might be worthwhile to play around with that, if only a little, while you're still working on parsing, to get a feel for how hard Minecraft interaction will be.

Seems like you're making progress, hopefully you can demo something soon!
